**@RestController vs @RepositoryRestResource vs @RepositoryRestController**
@RepositoryRestResource - to annotate repository - "to customize export mapping and rels."
@RepositoryRestResource is used to set options on the public Repository interface - 
it will automatically create endpoints as appropriate based on the type of Repository that is being extended 
(i.e. CrudRepository/PagingAndSortingRepository/etc).

@BasePathAwareController and @RepositoryRestController are used when you want to manually create endpoints, 
but want to use the Spring Data REST configurations that you have set up.

@RestController, you will create a parallel set of endpoints with different configuration options - i.e. 
a different message converter, different error handlers, etc - but they will happily coexist (and probably cause confusion).

No.
[ "The association resource" ](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-resources.association-resource)
The POST method is supported only for collection associations. It adds a new element to the collection.



Spring Data REST finds projection definitions as follows:
    Any @Projection interface found in the same package as your entity definitions (or one of its sub-packages) is registered.
    You can manually register a projection by using RepositoryRestConfiguration.getProjectionConfiguration().addProjection(â€¦).

BUG? app start - get traces collection - I get one of:
-Pagination OK + excerpt projection OK + NO links to headers (NOK)
-No pagination, no projection, but links are present
Resolved - there were 2 repositories for the same entity type. Shame on me.
