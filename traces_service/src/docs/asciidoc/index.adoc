Traces service API documentation

== Trace lifecycle

- Create an empty Trace with given *paymentId*

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/create-without-headers/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/create-without-headers/http-response.adoc[]

- Create a Trace with given *paymentId* and predefined set of *headers*

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/create-with-headers/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/create-with-headers/http-response.adoc[]


- Get Trace by *paymentId*

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/get-existing-trace/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/get-existing-trace/http-response.adoc[]


- Delete Trace by *paymentId*

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/delete-existing-trace/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/delete-existing-trace/http-response.adoc[]


== Trace Headers management

Sample Header management operations that can be applied to the Trace like this:

.Sample
include::{snippets}/traces/existing-trace-before-put-headers/response-body.adoc[]

- *Update* multiple headers at once (*rewriting* existing ones) by updating Trace object

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/put-trace-headers/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/put-trace-headers/http-response.adoc[]

As a result, Trace will look like:

.Trace with rewritten headers
include::{snippets}/traces/trace-after-put-headers/response-body.adoc[]

- *Patch* multiple headers at once (*merging with* existing ones) by updating Trace object

TIP: passing NULL as header value leads to its deletion.

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/patch-trace-headers/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/patch-trace-headers/http-response.adoc[]

- Alternative way to add Header:

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/add-single-header/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/add-single-header/http-response.adoc[]

- Get Header value by name

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/get-single-header/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/get-single-header/http-response.adoc[]


- Delete Header value by name
.request
include::{snippets}/traces/delete-header/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/delete-header/http-response.adoc[]


== Trace Events management

- Add event to the Trace

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/add-event/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/add-event/http-response.adoc[]

- List all Trace events

.request
include::{snippets}/traces/list-events/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/traces/list-events/http-response.adoc[]
